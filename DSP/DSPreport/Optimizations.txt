DSP specifics in details.

Approach for Optimization:
	Analytically, it was obvious that convolve would be a bottleneck because
	it is the only nested for loop in the program. Profiling with a simulator confirmed this.
	After optimizing convolve, quantize and dequantize turned out to be the next bottlenecks.
	Pen&paper approach: Negeren?
	
Compiler:
	-mt: we use -mt (--no_bad_aliases) in the release mode, and have used the 'restrict'
	keyword where possible
