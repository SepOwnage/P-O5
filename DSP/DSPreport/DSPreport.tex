\section{Introduction}

\section{Pre-Optimization in C}
Already sped up 100\% in C by improving the innermost loop.

\section{Optimization for DSP}

\section{Application description (If it has been already described earlier in the report, then you may refer to it and need not repeat it again)}
Detailed description of the application along with a figure/diagram \\
Explain different functions in the application: Purpose, functionality, complexity, etc

\section{Porting and integration}
About porting of project from linux to CCS simulator \\
About porting of the project from CCS simulator to the board \\
About integration with speech/crypto \\
Issues faced and what was done to resolve it

\section{Optimizations}
Table (as in template) \\
Explain all optimizations tried: example of the optimization, discuss the impact of the optimization and reasoning behind the impact you saw \\
The table is only a concise overview. You must explain in details

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
• & Major Optimization & Functions Effected & Cycles Before & Cycles After & Change (in \%) \\ 
\hline 
Base Code & • & • & • & • & • \\ 
\hline 
Session 1 & • & • & • & • & • \\ 
\hline 
• & • & • & • & • & • \\ 
\hline 
Session 2 & • & • & • & • & • \\

\end{table}




\section{Lessons learnt}
About your learning experience from the course.\\
How decisions taken earlier in the design flow impacted the performance of your code on DSP as
well as the scope of optimizations\\
 Your suggestions for improving the content and/or teaching of the course (DSP part specifically) for
coming years

\section{Conclusions}

\section{Appendix}
List of your functions and in which files (.c, .h) are they declared \& defined, such that it can help the assistants going through the code (if needed)
